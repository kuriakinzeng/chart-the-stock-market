# Free Code Camp's Chart the Stock Market Basecamp Challenge

**tl;dr:** This app allows users visualize the recent trend lines for stocks

## User Stories:
1. I can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock
2. I can add new stocks by their symbol name
3. I can remove stocks
4. I can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock. For this you will need to use Web Sockets

## Architecture
The app is built on Express with Socket.io support and server-rendering Vue. It uses [hackathon-starter](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter) as a boilerplate.

## Run locally
```npm install && npm run dev```

## Deploy to AWS
